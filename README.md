You can find quantum computing and information science projects done under the guidance of Dr. Shenglong Xu, Texas A&M

Some of the current projects I am working on:
1. Q-racing: a car racing game based on quantum principles. employs quantum superposition of n-qubit vectors. user applies gates to the state to collapse under measurement.
2. Verified quantum information scrambling - replicating using IBM Qiskit
3. Simulating basic quantum gates and operators
